# Palasoliisi - Mobile game

This game was created as a part of TAMKâ€™s mandatory project/game course. In this project we worked closely with a client who had a fixed theme for the game. Our client was Infotester4Education.

### Game overview

Game works with basic point and click mechanics.
Palasoliisi is story driven puzzle game.
Animations, dialogues, minigames, and clickable furniture with sound effects create an interactive game experience for the player.

### Teaser

Step into the paws of Bernand, the cunning bear! Save a struggling village from the grasps of disinformation - only you can save them.

Solve memory puzzles to uncover which news spreading through the town is true and which is false. Who is behind the lies?

Identify, analyze and expose false information! Are you clever enough to fix the false claims?
